16-bit-risc
===========
Designed and created a 16-bit Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) style microprocessor. The project included making several components using Altera Quartus II written in VHDL. Some of the components needed for a microprocessor, Arithmetic Logic Unit, Registers, Data Memory, Instruction Memory and more. The microprocessor was to run a reduced set of 16-bit MIPS assembly instructions. This was done along side a class at the University of Alaska Fairbanks in the undergraduate program
